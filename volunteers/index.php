    <p>We are unfortunately unable to take further registrations from volunteers to teach our courses or to act as role players. We expect to reopen registrations in mid 2021 (exact times TBC). Registration links for facilitators and actors will be provided here once registration reopens.</p>
    <p>If you have registered with us as a CCS facilitator or volunteer, you will be contacted by email by the end of January to provide further details about training. This will probably be held online via Zoom - a link will be provided via email and copied here closer to the date. We will mainly keep you posted by email, but a copy of any information we send out will be provided here for easier reference. If you have a Raven account, <a href="/volunteers/actors"><b>click here</b></a> to log into the volunteer portal. </p>
    <p>If you have any suggestions or comments, please contact us at <a href="mailto:cambridgeinternationalccs@gmail.com"><b>our official email address</b></a>.</p>
